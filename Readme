This code changes the way wp-admin is seen, to make it more relaxed for the eyes of everyone to edit with it. But it is specially useful for visually impairment / low vision / low sight people.

To introduce this code:

1. install a pluggin like Admin CSS MU:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-css-mu/

it is very easy to use, just after instaling the plugin.

2. Clic "Add CSS" and paste the code. 

3. Make sure Load Admin CSS is marked and Save CSS. 

Works best with the theme Blocksy. For other themes it does work too, but you might need an small change to make it perfect.
