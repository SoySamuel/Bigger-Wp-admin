This code changes the way wp-admin is seen, to make it more relaxed for the eyes of everyone to edit with it. But it is specially useful for visually impairment / low vision / low sight people.

To introduce this code:

1. install a plugin like Admin CSS MU:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-css-mu/

it is very easy to use, just after installing the plugin.

2. Clic "Add CSS" and paste the code. 

3. Make sure Load Admin CSS is marked and Save CSS. 


THEMES:

Designed in Blocksy, tested in Astra, and Hello Elementor. It doesnÂ´t change anything in Twenty-Twenty-Three or Twenty-Twenty-Four... and subsequent, for which we need to change the classes.
