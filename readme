This code changes the way wp-admin is seen, to make it more relaxed for the eyes of everyone to edit with it. It is specially useful for visually impaired people.
To introduce this code, install a pluggin like Admin CSS MU:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-css-mu/

it is very easy to use, just after instaling the plugin, clic "Add CSS" and paste the code of your liking. Make sure Load Admin CSS is marked and Save CSS.
